        Nike produces many items but mainly sells footwear.Over the years nike started sponsoring other professinal players and also started naming shoes after the sponsors. One of the biggest times I can remember Nike doing this was when Nike sponsored Lebron James a famous basketball player and he would wear the shoes and they were called "Air Jordans" and they claimed it would help you jump higher. This wasnt the case but Lebron wore them every game and pepole would buy them to be like him or just to have nice shoes but at the same time they were buying this the shoes cost over 200 dollars.
